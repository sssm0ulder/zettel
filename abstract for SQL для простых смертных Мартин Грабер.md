# Introduction to relational databases
## What is a relational database?
[[relational database]] is related information represented in the form of two-dimensional tables
[[In relational databases the order of the lines is not important.]]
[[In relational databases  string and record - are the same term]]
# Introduction in SQL
## How SQL works?
[[SQL - is a programming language used for managing and manipulating data in relational databases]]
[[Standart of SQL is definited by the ANSI]]
[[What is defined by ANSI is not always the best solution in practice]]
[[Creators of SQL products often deviate from the ANSI standard in favor of a better practical application]]
## Interactive version of SQL
There are two SQL: iteractive and embedded.
[[Interactive sql]] is used to perform actions directly in the database program (or interactive shell)
[[Embedded sql]] is used from within the programming language by means of certain modules.
[[Interactive sql and Embedded sql have no difference in their results. Only the way the sql instructions are executed differs]]
[[Data types in SQL]]
[[Some implementations of SQL-systems do not support some data types that are defined in the SQL standard]]
## Agreements and terminology
[[Keywords in SQL are words with the role of an instruction, not variable names or text]]
[[statements in sql]]
[[SQL clauses start with the main word and include keywords and arguments.]]
[[Objects in SQL are structures in the database that have names and are stored in memory.]]
[[a database in SQL is a set of related tables where data is stored in relational form and can be manipulated using the SQL language.]]
# Using SQL to fetch data from tables
[[query in sql]]
[[queries are the most frequently used part of SQL]]
