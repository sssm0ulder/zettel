	In a small village, there was a water problem. The village did not have its own water supply, and people had to walk a long distance to get water. A smart S saw an opportunity to make some money. He went to the village and said, "I will deliver water to you every day for a certain price." The villagers were happy, and the S started delivering water every day. He was making good money, and the villagers were happy because they did not have to walk to get water.
	One day, a smart B came to the village and saw the same opportunity. He also said, "I will deliver water to you every day for a certain price." The villagers were confused and asked him, "But we already have someone delivering water to us. Why do we need you?"
	The B smiled and said, "You don't just need water. You need a reliable and continuous water supply. What happens if the S gets sick or goes on vacation? You will be without water. But I have a solution. I will dig a well, install a pump, and lay pipes to your village. With my system, you will have a reliable and continuous water supply. You won't have to worry about anything."
	The villagers saw the value in the B's proposal, and they agreed to pay him the same price as the S. The B invested his money, time, and effort into setting up the water system, and soon he had a reliable and continuous income stream.
	The S, on the other hand, was still delivering water every day. He was making money, but he was also working hard. He had to wake up early every morning, fill his truck with water, and drive to the village to deliver the water. He was making money, but he was not building any assets.
	The B, on the other hand, had built an asset. He had invested his money, time, and effort into setting up the water system. Now, he was making money even when he was not physically present. He had created a passive income stream.


This story illustrates the difference in thinking between an S and a B. An S thinks in terms of immediate income. A B thinks in terms of building assets that generate income. An S works hard for money. A B makes money work hard for him.
