FROM, just like SELECT, is a keyword that must be presented in every query. It is followed by a space, and then by the name of the table that is used as the source of the information for the query.

Example:
```sql.
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table1;
```
Here `table1` is the name of the table that contains some records and columns `column1, column2, column3`
