- Artificial intelligence is a field in which people have created "smart" algorithms that "think" like humans
- AI's are just a math functions like `f(x)`, but with big count of parameters and outputs

These algorithms can write **essays**, solve **math problems**, and create **art**. Recent advances in the field have created AIs so advanced that they can write convincing **sales emails**, **news articles**, and even **win [art competitions](https://impakter.com/art-made-by-ai-wins-fine-arts-competition/)**.

	Although AI is extremely useful, it requires humans to direct it on what to do. Often AIs are like very smart five-year-olds.
